# Student-Result-Analyser
The Student Result Analyser is a web-based application that automates the traditional manual process of managing student performance records and generating results. It provides an efficient, accurate, and paperless system for storing student data and generating report cards and performance analysis.

This project is developed using PHP for backend logic and MySQL for database management, making it suitable for handling structured academic records in a reliable and scalable way.

# Technologies Used:
1. **Frontend:** Built with HTML and CSS for structure and visual appeal, ensuring device accessibility.
2. **Backend:** Powered by PHP for dynamic content, secure database interactions, and user authentication.
3. **Database:** I have used XAMPP to manage the MySQL database, leveraging its comprehensive development environment for seamless database management and integration with the website.
3. **Interactivity:** JavaScript adds form validation and dynamic page elements for an engaging user experience.
